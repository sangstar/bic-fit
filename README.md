# bic-fit


A package I've been working on which takes array-like x and y data, generates polynomial and piecewise (maximally 3 model breaks) fit parameters and evaluates the BIC score used. Makes certain assumptions as to the nature of the error, listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion#Gaussian_special_case
